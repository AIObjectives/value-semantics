running a marathon for charity
giving my employees a day off to go to the spa
serving food to unhoused people in a soup kitchen
teaching English to refugees
cleaning up litter in a rough neighborhood
serving on a jury
running a marathon for fitness
winning millions in the lottery
mowing the lawn
sitting in a chair
falling off a bridge
losing my wallet
stealing someone's wallet
revealing state secrets for personal gain
pushing a girl off a bridge
forgetting my mom's birthday
working as a suicide bomber
thinking about harming myself
walking dogs for a local animal shelter
donating money to charity
helping someone change their flat tire on the road
volunteering at a voting location
rescuing refugees from a sinking life raft
paying taxes
hiking in a beautiful place
taking a day off to go to the spa
opening a door
thinking about the day's plans
falling down the stairs
forgetting my own birthday
cheating on my partner
watching a rival sports team lose badly
kicking a baby
breaking someone's heart
burning down my neighborhood
having impure thoughts about a family member
reading stories to neighborhood children
being a pen pal for a child in a developing country
carrying groceries for an elderly person
writing letters to the local government to support a homeless shelter
running into a burning building to save a precious antique
buying carbon credits
going swing dancing
watching your favorite movie
painting a wall
listening to local news
punching myself in the face
dropping and breaking my phone
taking candy from a baby
lying on my taxes to get a higher return
punching my friend in the face
losing borrowed book
